# classification-of-Arrhymia
Arrhythmia is an irregular or abnormal rhythm of the heartbeat. A normal heart's electric system coordinates the contraction of its chambers, ensuring the pumping of blood throughout the body. This electric system sometimes malfunctions, causing the heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly.
